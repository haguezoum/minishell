# Prompt Explanation

**The Prompt:**
The prompt is a string that is displayed to the user in the command-line interface. It typically indicates that the system is ready to accept input from the user.
In the context of the *minishell* program, the prompt serves as a visual indicator for the user to enter their commands.

**Purpose of the Prompt:**
- The prompt provides a consistent and recognizable interface for the user to interact with the shell.
- It helps users differentiate between the system output and their input by visually indicating the command line.
- The prompt also adds a level of interactivity to the shell, making it user-friendly and facilitating a smooth user experience.

**How the Prompt is Used:**
- In the code provided, the `readline()` function is used to display the prompt and read user input.
- The `readline()` function takes the prompt string as an argument and displays it before waiting for user input.
- Once the user enters a command and presses Enter, the input is returned as a string.
- The `line` variable stores the user input obtained from `readline()`.

**Command History Mechanism:**
The command history mechanism allows users to retrieve and reuse previously entered commands.
- In the *minishell* program, the `add_history()` function is used to save the user's input into a history list of commands.
- By using the `add_history()` function, the entered command is stored in memory and can be accessed later.
- Users can navigate through the command history using the arrow keys (up and down) to retrieve and repeat previous commands.

**Purpose of the Command History:**
- The command history feature enhances user productivity by allowing them to easily access and reuse previously executed commands.
- It provides a convenient way to recall and repeat complex or frequently used commands without retyping them.
- Users can edit or modify commands from the history before executing them again.

In summary, the prompt serves as a visual indicator for user input, guiding users to enter commands. The command history mechanism allows users to access and reuse previously entered commands, enhancing productivity and convenience. Together, the prompt and command history contribute to a more interactive and efficient user experience in the *minishell* program.
